/* _c() is TextEditingStyle enum name, TextStyle enum name, padding, then
   TextEditingStyleUniform constructor arguments. _s() is then additionally
   with a selection override for the TextStyle as the second argument.

   Put into a dedicated file to be able to put as much as possible into
   constexpr arrays without losing the correspondence between TextEditingStyle
   and the actual items. Matching order tested in StyleTest, see all #includes
   of this file in Style.cpp for actual uses.

   So far there's no need to have a different count of styles and uniforms, so
   it's all together, and the file is included once to extract uniform data and
   once to extract other style properties. To not need to wrap the padding in
   ()s, _c is expected to take all four values of it separately. */
