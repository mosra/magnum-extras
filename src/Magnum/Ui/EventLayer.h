/**
@brief Event handling layer
@m_since_latest

Provides signal/slot-like functionality, connecting events happening on nodes
with arbitrary functions handling them.

@section Ui-EventLayer-setup Setting up an event layer instance

If you create a @ref UserInterfaceGL instance with a style and don't exclude
@ref StyleFeature::EventLayer, an implicit instance is already provided and
available through @ref UserInterface::eventLayer(). Otherwise, the event layer
doesn't have any shared state or configuration, so it's just about constructing
it from a fresh @ref AbstractUserInterface::createLayer() handle and passing it
to @ref UserInterface::setEventLayerInstance():

@snippet Ui-gl.cpp EventLayer-setup-implicit

In comparison, if you want to set up a custom event layer that's independent of
the one exposed through @ref UserInterface::eventLayer(), pass the newly
created instance to @ref AbstractUserInterface::setLayerInstance() instead:

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-setup

@section Ui-EventLayer-create Creating event handlers

An event handler is created by calling one of the `on*()` APIs with a
@ref NodeHandle to react on (or any @ref AbstractWidget "Widget" instance,
since it's implicitly convertible to a @ref NodeHandle as well) and a desired
function. For example, using @ref onTapOrClick() to print a message to standard
output when a button is tapped or clicked:

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-create

By default the event handler is tied to lifetime of the node it's added to. You
can use the returned @ref DataHandle to @ref remove() it earlier, if needed. As
an alternative, all APIs have `on*Scoped()` variants that return a
[RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization)
@ref EventConnection instance that removes the handler when destructed, which
is useful for example when the lifetime is tied to a concrete class instance.
In the following snippet, the @ref onTapOrClickScoped() in addition uses a @relativeref{Corrade,Containers::Function} created from a member function
instead of a lambda:

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-create-scoped

@section Ui-EventLayer-tap-click-press-release Tap or click, press & release

A function passed to @ref onTapOrClick() gets called when a
@ref Pointer::MouseLeft, primary @ref Pointer::Finger or @ref Pointer::Pen
(i.e., a pointer type that's understood as performing the primary action) is
pressed and subsequently released on the same node. Relying on
@ref Ui-AbstractUserInterface-events-capture "pointer capture" being implicitly
enabled on a @m_class{m-label m-info} **press**, the pointer is allowed to
leave the area when being pressed. If a @m_class{m-label m-danger} **release**
then happens with the pointer back over the node, it's still recognized as a
tap or click, which improves reliability especially with imprecise touch input.
On the other hand, releasing with a pointer outside of the node will not be
recognized as a tap or click, which is a common usage pattern for canceling
accidental UI actions.

@htmlinclude ui-eventlayer-tap-or-click.svg

The @ref onMiddleClick() and @ref onRightClick() APIs then expose the same
functionality for @ref Pointer::MouseMiddle or @ref Pointer::MouseRight. Right
now, @ref Pointer::Eraser doesn't have any matching event handler. Finally, the
@ref onPress() and @ref onRelease() counterparts get called when
@ref Pointer::MouseLeft, primary @ref Pointer::Finger or @ref Pointer::Pen gets
pressed or released.

All these functions have additional overloads that pass a node-relative
position to the handler, useful in case the position matters. For example to
calculate a concrete color when pressing on a color picker:

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-tap-position

@section Ui-EventLayer-drag Pointer drag

The @ref onDrag() API calls a function when @ref Pointer::MouseLeft, primary
@ref Pointer::Finger or @ref Pointer::Pen is dragged over a node, passing a
relative movement position to it. The handler is called only if the event is
@ref Ui-AbstractUserInterface-events-capture "captured on the node", i.e. when
the drag started on it in the first place. Which prevents accidental action,
such as when dragging from outside of the active UI area, however at the same
time it also allows the pointer to leave the node when dragging without the
action being aborted. Such behavior is useful especially when interacting with
narrow UI elements such as scrollbars or sliders.

@htmlinclude ui-eventlayer-drag.svg

Below is an example of a (vertical) scrollbar implementation affecting a
scrollable view. At its core, a scroll area is a node with @ref NodeFlag::Clip
enabled, containing another larger node within, and the scrolling is performed
by adjusting offset of the inner node with
@ref AbstractUserInterface::setNodeOffset(). Additionally the code makes sure
it doesn't scroll beyond either of the edges.

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-drag

As with other pointer event handlers, there's also an overload taking both a
movement delta and a position within a node.

@subsection Ui-EventLayer-drag-to-scroll Scrolling using pointer drag

A common touch interface pattern for scrollable views is to drag on the view
itself, without any scroll bars. Compared to above, the following implements
scrolling using drag in both directions, with @ref onDrag() set up on the
`scrollarea` itself:

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-drag-to-scroll

This however only works only as long as the drag isn't initiated on an inner
node that itself accepts events, even if just for visual feedback. Because as
shown for the tap or click above, as soon as a press gets accepted by an inner
node, further events get captured on it and don't reach the scroll area. A
solution is to enable @ref NodeFlag::FallthroughPointerEvents on the scroll
area containing the @ref onDrag() handler. That'll cause it to receive also all
events that were accepted on inner nodes.

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-drag-to-scroll-fallthrough

With this option it doesn't take over the drag events unconditionally because
even just a tap where the pointer moves slightly between a press and a release
would be interpreted as a drag of the whole area, making it almost impossible
to interact with the inner contents. Instead, there's a distance threshold,
configurable with @ref setDragThreshold(), after which the press, move and
release is no longer treated as a tap or click, but gets interpreted as a drag.
Thus, after a press, the drag will be initially directed to items underneath,
highlighting them for example, and only after reaching the threshold it'll jump
and start scrolling instead of affecting the items underneath. See
@ref Ui-AbstractUserInterface-events-fallthrough for a detailed description of
this behavior.

@htmlinclude ui-eventlayer-drag-fallthrough.svg

@m_class{m-note m-warning}

@par
    At the moment, nesting of multiple draggable scroll areas isn't implemented
    and doesn't behave gracefully. Dragging will cause all of them to scroll
    simultaneously.

If the contents don't need to be interacted with in any way, an alternative is
to enable @ref NodeFlag::NoEvents on them. In that case there will be no scroll
delay, as the events will always go directly to the scroll area.

@section Ui-EventLayer-scroll Scroll

With @ref onScroll() you can react to mouse wheel or touchpad scroll events.
Note that in this case, compared to @ref onDrag(), the offset is not in UI
units, but rather scroll *steps*, where @cpp 1.0f @ce usually maps to one tick
of a mouse scroll wheel, with right and up being positive. Such a step value is
useful mainly for implementing actions like changing currently selected item in
a dropdown or adjusting numeric values, however note that depending on the
platform and system settings the step may also be a fractional value, and even
with a magnitude less than one. Which means a plain integer conversion may
result in it being zero.

The @ref onDragOrScroll() then combines @ref onDrag() and @ref onScroll(),
which is useful for scrollable views that want to react to both scroll events
and pointer drag. In this case, the scroll step value is multiplied a factor
configurable with @ref setScrollStepDistance() to get an equivalent of a
pointer drag distance. If scrolling using pointer drag is undesirable, you can
also just use @ref onScroll() and do the multiplication with
@ref scrollStepDistance() directly.

@section Ui-EventLayer-pinch Pinch zoom and rotation

On input devices supporting multi-touch, @ref onPinch() calls a function as
soon as two fingers are pressed and dragged relatively to each other, passing
it a scale, rotation and translation delta. As with @ref onDrag(), the gesture
is only recognized when it started on given node but the pointers can leave the
area when pressed. As an example, the following snippet implements two-finger
panning in a drawing application while the single-pointer @ref onDrag() would
be used for drawing:

@m_class{m-console-wrap}

@snippet Ui.cpp EventLayer-pinch

@section Ui-EventLayer-press-release-enter-leave-focus-blur Pointer enter and leave, focus and blur

With @ref onEnter() and @ref onLeave() you can implement various actions
happening when the primary pointer enters or leaves the node area. Usually
there's however just visual feedback, which is likely already handled by
@ref BaseLayer and @ref TextLayer style transitions.

For nodes that have @ref NodeFlag::Focusable enabled, @ref onFocus() and
@ref onBlur() can attach actions to an input being focused and blurred again,
for example to open a keypad or an autocompletion popup.
