        -   `screenspacePointDirection` contains screenspace direction from
            `transformedPosition` to the actual point. After undoing the
            screenspace projection the sum of the two is written to
            gl_Position.
        -   `centerDistanceSigned` contains signed distance from the edge to
            center, passed to the fragment shader. It's chosen in a way that
            interpolates to zero in the quad center, and the area where
            `all(abs(centerDistanceSigned) <= vec2(halfSegmentLength +
            capDistance, edgeDistance))` is inside the line.
        -   `hasCap` contains `abs(centerDistanceSigned.x)` with a sign
            positive if the point is a cap and negative if it isn't. Given
            segment endpoints A and B (and quad points 0/1 and 2/3
            corresponding to these), the following cases can happen:

            -   if both have a cap, it's a negative value in both, thus has a
                constant negative value in the fragment shader
            -   if neither have a cap, it's a positive value in both, thus has
                a constant positive value in the fragment shader
            -   if one has a cap and the other not, it's a negative value in
                one and positive in the other, interpolating to zero in the
                quad center

       In the fragment shader, `abs(centerDistanceSigned)` and `sign(hasCap)`
       is then used to perform cap rendering and antialiasing. For example,
       with a standalone line segment that has square caps on both ends, the
       value of `centerDistanceSigned` is like in the following diagram, with
       `d` being `halfSegmentLength`, `w` being `edgeDistance`, `c` being
       `capDistance`, and an extra margin for `smoothness` indicated by `s` and
       the double border:

    [-d-c-s,+w+s]                 [+d+c+s,+w+s]
           0-----------------------------2
        [-d-c,+w]------------------[+d+c,+w]
           | |                         | |      hasCap[0] = hasCap[1] = +d+c+s
        [-d-c,0]        [0,0]      [+d+c,0]
           | |                         | |      hasCap[2] = hasCap[3] = +d+c+s

           1-----------------------------3
    [-d-c-s,-w-s]                 [+d+c+s,-w+s]

       With a cap only on the left side, `centerDistanceSigned` would be like
       this. Note the absence of a smoothness margin on the right side:

    [-d-c-s,+w+s]                   [+d,+w+s]
           0---------------------------2

           from above, and `j` having the length that's needed to scale
           `perpendicular(normalized(d + nd))` to get point 2:

           Then, vector j is the following, meaning we avoid the normalization
           square root completely:

                    perp(d + nd)   (2 w)perp(d + nd)
            j = |j| ------------ = -----------------
                      |d + nd|        dot(d + nd)
