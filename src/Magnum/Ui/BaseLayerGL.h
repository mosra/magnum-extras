@brief OpenGL implementation of the base layer
@m_since_latest_{extras}

See the @ref BaseLayer base class documentation for information about setting
up an instance of this layer and using it. The base class contains most of the
interface you'll be interacting with, this subclass exposes just the APIs tied
to OpenGL, such as texture setup.

The layer assumes @ref RendererGL is set on the user interface (or
@ref UserInterfaceGL used, which does so automatically), see its documentation
for more information about GL state expectations. The layer produces geometry
in a counter-clockwise winding, so @ref GL::Renderer::Feature::FaceCulling can
stay enabled when drawing it.

@note This class is available only if Magnum is compiled with
    @ref MAGNUM_TARGET_GL enabled (done by default). See @ref building-features
    for more information.
