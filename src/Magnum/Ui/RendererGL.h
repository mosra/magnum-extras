/**
@brief OpenGL renderer implementation
@m_since_latest_{extras}

Performs renderer state management for OpenGL layer implementations such as
@ref BaseLayerGL or @ref TextLayerGL.

@section Ui-RendererGL-setup Setting up a renderer instance

If you use one of the @ref UserInterfaceGL constructors taking a style,
@ref UserInterfaceGL::create(), @relativeref{UserInterfaceGL,tryCreate()},
@relativeref{UserInterfaceGL,setStyle()} or
@relativeref{UserInterfaceGL,trySetStyle()}, an implicit renderer instance is
already set up by those. If you don't, or if you want to set up a
custom-configured renderer before specifying a style, pass its instance to
@ref AbstractUserInterface::setRendererInstance():

@snippet Ui-gl.cpp RendererGL-setup

When @ref AbstractUserInterface::draw() is executed, the renderer internally
enables @ref GL::Renderer::Feature::Blending and/or
@relativeref{GL::Renderer,Feature::ScissorTest} for layers that advertise
@ref LayerFeature::DrawUsesBlending and/or @ref LayerFeature::DrawUsesScissor,
the scissor rectangle is then reset back to the whole framebuffer size (as
supplied to the user interface constructor or
@ref AbstractUserInterface::setSize()) after drawing.

@section Ui-RendererGL-compositing-framebuffer Use with a compositing framebuffer

By default, the @ref RendererGL instance assumes *some* framebuffer is bound
for drawing and it doesn't touch the binding in any way. Layers that implement
compositing operations however need a framebuffer which can be both drawn into
and read from, which is achieved by constructing the renderer with
@link Flag::CompositingFramebuffer @endlink:

@snippet Ui-sdl2.cpp RendererGL-compositing-framebuffer

With the flag enabled, the application is then responsible for clearing the
@ref compositingFramebuffer() at frame start, drawing all content underneath
the UI to it, and ultimately blitting it back to the main / default application
framebuffer after the UI is drawn:

@snippet Ui-sdl2.cpp RendererGL-compositing-framebuffer-draw

@note This class is available only if Magnum is compiled with
    @ref MAGNUM_TARGET_GL enabled (done by default). See @ref building-features
    for more information.
