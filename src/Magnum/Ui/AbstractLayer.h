         * Node handles corresponding to @p dataIds are available in

         * @p nodeOffsets, @p nodeSizes, @p nodeOpacities and @p nodesEnabled
         * views. The @p nodeOffsets, @p nodeSizes, @p nodeOpacities and
         * @p nodesEnabled have the same size and are guaranteed to be large
         * enough to contain any valid node ID.
         *
         * All @ref nodes() at indices corresponding to @p dataIds are
         * guaranteed to not be @ref NodeHandle::Null at the time this function
         * is called. The @p nodeOffsets, @p nodeSizes, @p nodeOpacities and

         * for nodes different than those referenced from @p dataIds, such as
         * for nodes that are not currently visible or freed node handles.
         *
         * The node data are meant to be clipped by rects defined in
         * @p clipRectOffsets and @p clipRectSizes. The @p clipRectIds and
         * @p clipRectDataCounts have the same size and specify which of these
         * rects is used for which data. For example, a sequence of
         * @cpp {3, 2}, {0, 4}, {1, 7} @ce means clipping the first two data
         * with clip rect 3, then the next four data with clip rect 0 and then
         * the next seven data with clip rect 1. The sum of all
         * @p clipRectDataCounts is equal to the size of the @p dataIds array.
         * The @p clipRectOffsets and @p clipRectSizes have the same size and
         * are guaranteed to be large enough to contain any ID from
         * @p clipRectIds. They're in the same coordinate system as
         * @p nodeOffsets and @p nodeSizes, a zero offset and a zero size
         * denotes that no clipping is needed. Tt's up to the implementation
         * whether it clips the actual data directly or whether it performs
         * clipping at draw time.
         *
         * The @p compositeRectOffsets and @p compositeRectOffsets have the
         * same size and define rectangles to be used by compositing
         * operations, i.e. intersections of node rectangles with corresponding
         * clip rectangles. If the layer doesn't advertise
         * @ref LayerFeature::Composite, the views are empty.
